        	<h3>What are the benefits of poppy seeds?</h3>
			<p>There are lots of easy ways that poppy seeds can support your body's health. They help your body absorb vital vitamins and contain heart-healthy fats. Additionally, poppy seeds contain fiber, which aids in digestion and extends feelings of fullness following meals. They contain minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium that support muscles, strengthen bones, and improve blood health. Poppy seeds also have antioxidants that help protect your cells from harm. Poppy seeds can be a simple and healthy addition to regular foods like bread, bagels, salads, and snacks when consumed in small amounts. </p>

			<h3>How Poppy Seeds Are Harvested</h3>
			<p>The poppy plant's seed pods, which develop after the flowers bloom and fall off, are the source of poppy seeds. The tiny seeds won't be ready until the pods are completely dry, so farmers wait to gather them. The seeds are released by carefully opening or shaking the pods after they have been harvested. The seeds are then cleaned and sorted to make them safe to use in baking and cooking. This process guarantees that the poppy seeds we eat are fresh, high-quality, and ready to add flavor or texture to a variety of foods, but it requires time and attention to detail.</p>

			<h3>Our Background</h3>
			<div class="flexed">
				<img src="img/placeholder-fork.png" alt="Placeholder">
				<p>I am a student currently in the IT Business Analysis program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. Cooking and seeing the way small ingredients can affect a meal are always interesting to me. I find poppy seeds in particular interesting because they give the dish a hint of flavor and texture without overpowering it. They are most noticeable in foods like breads, bagels, and baked goods that I often eat. I now have better appreciation for poppy seeds in regular cooking after learning more about its history and uses. My research on poppy seeds showed me how even basic ingredients can greatly impact food. </p>
