        	<h3>What are the benefits of poppy seeds?</h3>
			<p>There are lots of easy ways that poppy seeds can support your body's health. They help your body absorb vital vitamins and contain heart-healthy fats. Additionally, poppy seeds contain fiber, which aids in digestion and extends feelings of fullness following meals. They contain minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium that support muscles, strengthen bones, and improve blood health. Poppy seeds also have antioxidants that help protect your cells from harm. Poppy seeds can be a simple and healthy addition to regular foods like bread, bagels, salads, and snacks when consumed in small amounts. </p>

					<h3>How Poppy Seeds Are Used in Cooking</h3>
					<p>Poppy seeds are useful in many different cuisines and can be prepared in a number of simple ways. They are frequently used to give breads, bagels, and rolls a crunchy texture and subtle flavor. To enhance the flavor and appearance of muffin, cake, and pastry batters, poppy seeds are added. Additionally, they give salad dressings, sauces, and spice blends more visual appeal and thickness. In some traditional recipes, poppy seeds are ground into pastes and used as fillings or toppings. These illustrations show how poppy seeds are commonly used in cooking because of their adaptability, simplicity in preparation, and versatility in a range of recipes. </p>

					<h3>History and Origins of Poppy Seeds</h3>
					<p>For thousands of years, poppy seeds have been added to food. They were used in breads and pastries in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome. They were popular because they were long-lasting and added flavor. Poppy seeds have been traded to many nations over the years. They have been crucial to cooking for a very long time, as evidenced by the fact that many traditional recipes still call for them today. Poppy seeds are still used today in both special and everyday recipes all over the world.</p>

			<h3>How Poppy Seeds Are Harvested</h3>
			<p>The poppy plant's seed pods, which develop after the flowers bloom and fall off, are the source of poppy seeds. The tiny seeds won't be ready until the pods are completely dry, so farmers wait to gather them. The seeds are released by carefully opening or shaking the pods after they have been harvested. The seeds are then cleaned and sorted to make them safe to use in baking and cooking. This process guarantees that the poppy seeds we eat are fresh, high-quality, and ready to add flavor or texture to a variety of foods, but it requires time and attention to detail.</p>

			<h3>When You’re Not in the Mood for Poppy Flavors</h3>
			<p>
			Sometimes I’m not really feeling poppy flavors and want something different, and that’s where <a href="https://spicedsumac.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Spiced Sumac</a> comes in. It’s a simple, friendly site all about sumac, a popular Middle Eastern spice known for its tangy, citrus-like flavor. The site feels like someone sharing a go-to seasoning they genuinely enjoy using in their own cooking. It explains how sumac works as a tangy seasoning that can brighten up foods like salads, grilled meats, and flatbreads without being overpowering. It also talks about how versatile sumac spice is and why it’s a great option when you want bold flavor without heat.

			<h3>Our Background</h3>
			<div class="flexed">
				<img src="img/placeholder-fork.png" alt="Placeholder">
				<p>I am a student currently in the IT Business Analysis program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. Cooking and seeing the way small ingredients can affect a meal are always interesting to me. I find poppy seeds in particular interesting because they give the dish a hint of flavor and texture without overpowering it. They are most noticeable in foods like breads, bagels, and baked goods that I often eat. I now have better appreciation for poppy seeds in regular cooking after learning more about its history and uses. My research on poppy seeds showed me how even basic ingredients can greatly impact food. </p>
