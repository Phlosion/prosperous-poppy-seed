        	<h3>A Recipe for Poppy Seed Cake</h3>
			<p>Poppy seed cake is a dessert which is soft in texture and has a subtle nutty flavour. The poppy seeds are spread evenly throughout the cake, giving it a light crunch that contrasts nicely with the moist crumb. Some common ingredients to make this cake include flour, sugar, eggs, milk and butter or oil, which makes a rich yet balanced base. Citrus flavours such as lemon or orange zest are also often added to improve the taste and elevate the natural flavour of poppy seeds. Due to the simple ingredients, poppy seed cake is easy to prepare while still feeling thoughtful and homemade.</p>
			<p>Poppy seed cake is usually kept simple instead of being heavily decorated with anything, so its flavour stands out. A sprinkle of powdered sugar or a thin lemon glaze is often enough. Poppy seed cake is commonly served with coffee or tea and is popular at family gatherings, holidays and casual events. Many people enjoy it because it feels familiar and comforting. Overall poppy seed cake is liked for being simple, easy to serve, and always enjoyable.</p>

			<h3>When You’re Not in the Mood for Poppy Flavors</h3>
			<p>
			Sometimes I’m not really feeling poppy flavors and want something different, and that’s where <a href="https://spicedsumac.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Spiced Sumac</a> comes in. It’s a simple, friendly site all about sumac, a popular Middle Eastern spice known for its tangy, citrus-like flavor. The site feels like someone sharing a go-to seasoning they genuinely enjoy using in their own cooking. It explains how sumac works as a tangy seasoning that can brighten up foods like salads, grilled meats, and flatbreads without being overpowering. It also talks about how versatile sumac spice is and why it’s a great option when you want bold flavor without heat.

			<h3>Our Background</h3>
			<div class="flexed">
				<img src="img/placeholder-fork.png" alt="Placeholder">
				<p>I am a student currently in the IT Business Analysis program at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. Cooking and seeing the way small ingredients can affect a meal are always interesting to me. I find poppy seeds in particular interesting because they give the dish a hint of flavor and texture without overpowering it. They are most noticeable in foods like breads, bagels, and baked goods that I often eat. I now have better appreciation for poppy seeds in regular cooking after learning more about its history and uses. My research on poppy seeds showed me how even basic ingredients can greatly impact food. </p>
